# Project ChompChomp (Gyo Fish!)

## A 2-week game jam that my brother and I are working on with our remaining summer availabilties. 

### The goal was/is to create simple micro-game that can stand as a minimal finished product. We aimed to mimic the mini game in Stardew Valley. I am developing the code, my brother is creating the art, and together we are designing the gameplay experience of the project.
